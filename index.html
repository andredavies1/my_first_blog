        <h2>A Mindset Shift</h2>
        <p>A collection of principles and ideas that I consider to be fundamental truths. I believe that if we apply these principles daily, the outcomes and results in our lives will improve dramatically. </p>
        <br></br>
        <p><strong>Verbage - </strong>Verbage is extremely important. The way we speak about ourselves influences how we operate. Therefore, at all times, we must speak positively about ourselves. 
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>The Winner - </strong> Winners are people whose habits and actions are aligned with success. Everything they do, the habits they instill, are the habits of a winner. A winner is not a final product, but rather a lifestyle.

            <p>In simpler terms, it’s a consistent set of actions that leads you to your destination. The same principle applies to losers—they are simply instilling losing behaviors. Their choices, the people they associate with, the actions they take, and their mindset all contribute to their outcome. How they view themselves and think about the world shapes their results.</p>
            
            <p>It’s important to reassess how you are operating. You can't expect a 10 out of 10 result if you're personally operating at a 2 out of 10. You can't hope for uphill progress while following downhill habits. To achieve success, you must follow a clear set of principles—then you will create a successful lifestyle. </p>
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Motivation - </strong> If you're not motivated, it’s usually for a few reasons: either you don't enjoy what you're doing, or you don't understand the mission behind it. But if you were in a really bad position—outside of your comfort zone, at a point of true desperation—you'd likely get your act together quickly. We live in a soft place where, often, we don’t truly want our ambitions and dreams. Because if you really wanted something, you'd put the time and effort into it. You’d make it a priority.

            You need to be fully committed to your goals. Be done with self-sabotage. You need to be here to challenge and conquer yourself, because if you can conquer yourself, you can conquer anyone. After all, you are the most difficult enemy you will ever face. If you can master yourself, you can build an empire from the ground up. If you're willing to commit to developing yourself full-time, you have the potential to build something truly great. Show up and commit.
